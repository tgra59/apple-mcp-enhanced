Mail Search Functionality - Technical Explanation

The Apple MCP email search functionality faces limitations due to Apple's security and privacy restrictions. After extensive troubleshooting and diagnostics, we've found that:

1. Issue Summary:
   - The Mail app restricts programmatic access to search through email content
   - This is intentional by Apple's design to protect user privacy
   - It's not a bug in our implementation, but a fundamental limitation of Mail's automation capabilities

2. Technical Details:
   - While we can access unread emails and basic account information
   - Deep searching through email content is restricted by Apple's security model
   - Both AppleScript and JavaScript for Automation (JXA) approaches are limited

3. Our Solution:
   - We've implemented a user-friendly message explaining the limitation
   - We continue to support other Mail functionality (unread emails, sending, accounts)
   - We provide instructions for users to search directly in the Mail app

This is consistent with Apple's focus on privacy and security. Similar limitations exist for other private data in macOS applications.

For users who need to search email:
1. Open the Mail app directly
2. Use the search feature in the top-right corner
3. Enter your search terms

Other Mail functionality such as reading unread emails, sending emails, and viewing account information continues to work normally through the Apple MCP server.
